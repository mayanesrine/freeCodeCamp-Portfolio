# Portfolio Webpage
A portfolio webpage in plain HTML and CSS, created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification (which I successfully completed. Woohoo!). This was the fifth and final project 
of the curriculum. The next step is to make a personal portfolio now that I have enough projects to showcase.

You can find the live preview [here](https://mayanesrine.github.io/freeCodeCamp-Portfolio/).
